# todo

This is an incredibly simple todo list application, meant to serve over time as a reference application for RESTful CRUD APIs.

## what's in this repo

In no particular order:

- An HTTPS-only server that serves a RESTful todo list API with Oauth2 authentication support
- a database implementation for sqlite3
- requisite dockerfiles for tests and running locally
- a models package for our API server, Client, and integration tests (and, as a consequence, whatever else) to share
- a Go client for the Server API
